## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run training:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

## Notes
- This is a minimal, educational example. For real 3D generation, see research like DreamFusion, Magic3D, or NeRF.
- The model uses random data for demonstration. Replace with real 3D datasets for practical use.
